# Universal Properties Widely Supported by Editors
# ------------------------------------------------
# root                      : special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to true to stop .editorconfig files search on current file.
# indent_style              : set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
# indent_size               : a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
# tab_width                 : a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified.
# end_of_line               : set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented.
# charset                   : set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set.
# trim_trailing_whitespace  : set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't.
# insert_final_newline      : set to true to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't.
